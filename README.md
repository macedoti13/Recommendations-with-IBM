## Project Overview <a name="overview"><a/>
**The project was composed of building several recommendation engines with various techniques in order to recommend data science related articles in IBM Watson's Studio Platform. An organized notebook was provided with instructions and checkpoints and I completed the code with my own knowledge. There was an extra (and optional) challenge to build a content based collaborative filtering recommender, which I completed using my NLP skills.**

## The Problem that Needed to be Solved <a name="problem"><a/>
**IBM Watson Studio has several data science and machine learning related articles. The problem is that users weren't receiving recommendations for new articles to read. So I had to create (a bunch of) recommendation engines in order to recommend new articles for users, so that they could find new things to read without having to actively search for them.**
